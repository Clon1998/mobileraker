# Mobileraker - Changelog

## [2.8.3] - 2024-12-08

### General

- **iOS Support**: Due to libraries used in the app, the app now requires iOS 15.5 or newer to run.

### Enhancements

- **Macro Visibility**: Added configurable printer state visibility for macros. Users can now hide macros irrelevant to
  the current printer state by tapping the macro in the group editor on the printer edit page.
- **Remote Services Randomization**: Randomized the order of remote services on the printer add and edit pages to ensure
  a more fair representation.
- **GCode File Sorting**: Added support for sorting GCode files by estimated print time, allowing users to quickly find
  the shortest or longest print jobs.
- **ETA Day Indicator**: Enhanced the ETA cell in the status card to display a `+n` to indicate that the ETA is in n
  days. (e.g., `+1` for tomorrow)
- **Heater Shortcut**: Added a convenient long-press gesture on the "Set" button within the heater card to instantly
  disable the heater, improving user interaction and control.

### Bug Fixes

- **GCode Preview**: Fixed a parser error in the GCode preview when the `SET_RETRACTION` command is used.

  distinguishes between different object kinds (e.g., `fan_generic` and `temperature_fan`) when preventing naming
  conflicts.

  streams simultaneously.

## [2.3.0] - 2023-05-19

This release signifies a significant shift in the philosophy governing the future of Mobileraker,
particularly regarding
its monetization strategy. However, let me begin by addressing the most crucial aspect. Currently,
there are no plans to
restrict major functional features behind paywalls or subscriptions—Mobileraker will remain open
source. Nevertheless,
due to the unsuccessful reliance on donations as the sole funding source and the absence of
long-term sponsorship from
any company or shop, the decision has been made to incorporate monetization directly within
Mobileraker.

With the introduction of this version, users now have the option to support the ongoing development
of Mobileraker
through in-app subscriptions. As a token of appreciation, supporters will gain access to an
exclusive Material 3-based
theme. In the future, additional perks such as UI enhancements or minor functional features may be
introduced.

### Major Changes

- Added a new "Support the Dev!" page to facilitate user contributions
- Improved integration by sharing webcam configuration with Mainsail/Fluidd
- Introduced a setting to automatically switch the fullscreen webcam to landscape
  mode ([#95](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker/issues/95))
- Implemented a "Printer Switch" dialog that opens when users tap the page's titlt (Note: Rapid
  printer switching can be
  done by swiping the title)
- Provided a helpful hint in the app settings
  if [mobileraker_companion](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker_companion) is not detected
- Added Romanian translation, thanks to [@vaxxi](https://github.com/vaxxi)
- Added Italian translation, thanks to [@Livex97](https://github.com/Livex97)

### Changed Features

- Added support for printers that do not utilize a print
  fan ([#158](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker/issues/158))
