## General

🏷️ Mobileraker works as a simple UI for Klipper on the phone. Connect it to an existing moonraker installation and
control the printer.

🧰 With Mobileraker, the user has access to critical machine commands:

- Pause, Resume, Stop a print job
- Monitor the print progress
- Control all axis of the machine
- Control the heaters
- Get the current temperature readings
- Control fans
- Control pins like LEDs
- Send GCode Macros
- Emergency Stop the machine

🛠️ Additionally, Mobileraker enables the user to monitor the machine via an integrated webcam viewer with support for
multiple cams, interact with the machine through the GCode console and browse the available GCode files to start a new
print job.
Mobileraker also offers comfort features like remote push notifications about the progress of a print job, temperature
presets.

✨ One more thing ...
Mobileraker can manage multiple machines!

✍🏻 Some final words from the project owner:
Hi,
My name is Patrick Schmidt, and I am the developer of Mobileraker. Mobileraker started as a small side project with the
intention to be able to control My 3D printer via My phone. After posting some screenshots of the app to the 3D printing
community, the public interest in Mobileraker grew, and I published it to the app stores.
As I am only able to work on Mobileraker in my free time, I am always thankful for support and feedback. Either via
lovely messages of people enjoying Mobileraker, good reviews in the store or through donations. I hope you enjoy
Mobileraker and happy printing 🙏!

## Push Notifications / Remote Notification
>**Note**  
> Android's progress notification (Shown in the Impression Images) is not supported anymore, due to a change in a 3rd party [library](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications). As soon as this library offers support for this kind of notification again, I will revisit the implementation (Feel free to contribute).

Mobileraker allows users to enable push notifications, which are also delivered if your phone is not in the same network as your klipperized 3D printer. To allow Mobileraker to send push notifications to your phone, please install and configure the [Mobileraker's Companion](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker_companion). You can learn more about it by visiting the [Mobileraker's Companion](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker_companion) GitHub project to learn more.
